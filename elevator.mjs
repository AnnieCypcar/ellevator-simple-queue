/*
The Elevator class utilizes a simple request queue to manage the next requested destination:

- When a rider requests a ride, the rider's current floor and destination floor are added to the queue.
- An interval runs continuously once the Elevator's `turnOn` function is invoked.
- The 100 ms interval ensures optimal user experience by providing responsive behavior for the elevator.
- Every 100 ms:
  - checks if the elevator has reached its destination and if new rides have been requested
  - also checks if the next request is another passenger entering or leaving the elevator
- Every 1 second:
  - The elevator moves to the next floor.
  - If the elevator reaches its destination, its direction is halted.
  - The current time and the elevator's status are logged.
